# IGW-Wave-Envelope-Speed-Project
Scripts written to use with Professor Kevin Lamb's IGW model

  These scripts were written and/or edited in the summer of 2024 as part of a Undergraduate Student Research Internship with Professor Kevin Lamb at the University of Waterloo, so I would like to acknowledge that all of this project is based off work done by him, as well as supervised by him. 
  The purpose of these scripts are to interpret and animate aspects of water wave data from numerical simulations ran in Kevin Lamb's IGW model. energy-balance.py and get_igw_energy_data.py are modules which plot the potential and kinetic energy contained in the simulated non-linear waves. 
  The contents of breather_1.zip are routines which use Hilbert Transform methods to calculate wave envelopes from the raw data from numerical simulations, and using the envelope, calculates a group velocity for the wave packet. 

Here is a link to a slideshow I created explaining some of the results from the summer research, which was done using these packages in conjunction with Kevin Lamb's IGW model code: https://tinyurl.com/5b6mkchx
